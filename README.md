### **Deployment Strategy: The Simple Sanitizer Service**

This approach is a great middle-ground. It's much faster than a scheduled job but avoids the complexity of a full logging pipeline. It uses a very common and familiar pattern: a simple API.

### **How It Works**

Instead of applications writing logs directly to a file that gets processed later, they will send their logs to a small, central service whose only job is to clean them.

1.  **Run the PII Script as a Service:** You'll run your Python script as a simple, continuously running web service on a server. It will listen for incoming network requests (specifically, HTTP POST requests).

2.  **Applications Send Logs:** Your application developers will make a minor change. Instead of writing a log to a file, they will send the log message as a simple HTTP request to your PII Sanitizer Service.

3.  **Sanitize in Real-Time:** The PII service instantly receives the log, runs your redaction logic on it, and gets a clean, safe version.

4.  **Write to Final Log File:** The PII service then takes this clean log and writes it to the final, official log file (e.g., `/var/log/sanitized-app.log`).

5.  **Monitoring:** Your monitoring and analysis tools can safely read from this clean log file at any time.

### **Justification**

* **✅ Uses Familiar Technology:** This doesn't require any complex or unknown software. It's a basic client-server model using HTTP, which is a fundamental building block of most software. Your Python script can be turned into a service with a few lines of code using a simple library like **Django**.

* **✅ Near Real-Time:** Logs are cleaned the moment they are created, which is a huge advantage over waiting for a scheduled job to run.

* **✅ Centralized and Simple:** All the PII logic lives in one simple service. If you need to update the rules, you only update it in one place.

* **✅ Minimal Change for Developers:** The change required in the application code is very small—they just switch from writing to a file to sending a web request, a task most developers are very familiar with.
